#Ludum Dare 30
## Wet-Dry Land

### Language
This game was created in the experimental OWL programming language. The OWL
compiler can be found on my github account,
[www.github.com/bsurmanski/wlc](here). 

This game was a test of the recent additions to OWL, including class types,
struct and class methods, extension methods, struct literals, and arrays.

OWL was previously used in a precursor form for the 2014 Global Game Jam, with
source code found [https://github.com/bsurmanski/GGJ2014](here).

### Gameplay
Cross the wet-dry volcanic lake! Jump between water and land to progress and
avoid the spikes.  When in water, gravity flips upside-down, allowing you to
traverse floating debris.
